            <br>
            <p><b>THE PROBLEM:</b> Users of an asset management app had to navigate complex folder trees in each time
                they needed to pull an asset leading to irritation.</p>

            <p><b>THE SOLUTION:</b> Integrate a function allowing users to ‘favorite’ a folder to provide quick access
                to frequently visited folders.</p>

            <p>Runner is an asset management application used by various groups within Sony Pictures Entertainment. At
                the time I worked on the application, the product was still in it’s early development but was already in
                use by the studio. The long term goal of Runner was to provide a faster, more user-friendly asset
                management system to replace shipping physical hard drives or existing file share systems in place.</p>
            <br>
            <p>As Runner was still in its early stages, users would have to navigate the folder tree each time they
                wanted access files from a specific folder. Through client meetings, users expressed desire for the
                ability to ‘bookmark’ folders for quick access.</p>

            <h3 class="sectionHead"><b>ICON DESIGN:</b></h3>
            <br>
            <p>As the concept behind ‘favorite’-ing a folder was simple, my team interestingly found the iconography to
                be the most challenging part of the feature. Initially, I sampled three different drafts of potential
                icons to indicate a folder was favorited. Interestingly, the team and testers were split on which icon
                they preferred. While icon #1 was favored by my team as it was more consistent with the design of other
                icons on Runner; icon #2 and icon #3 were favored by testers.</p>
            <br>

            </div>
            <br>
            <p>In the end, I decided to use icon #2.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Figuring the size of the icon would be about 20 x 20 pixels in its practical context, the star in icon #2
                would be most visible to users. The outline of stars in icon #1 and icon #3 would be harder to see at
                such a small size, making it less apparent to users that they had favorited the folder.</p>

            <h4 class="sectionSubHead"><b>Dashboard Widget:</b></h4>
            <br>
            <p>Adding a widget to the landing page was the first step. This way, users could immediately navigate to
                their favorited folders from their dashboard upon login.</p>

            <br>
            <p>As folders in the display already had a dropdown menu for deletion, I added the option to ‘favorite’
                within the menu and created a straight forward interaction. It also became apparent in testing to add a
                success notification, as the change in icons was not prevalent enough to note a successful transaction.
                After favoriting a folder, the folder would appear on the widget on their dashboard. Users could also
                ‘un-favorite’ a folder using the same dropdown menu on folders that had been favorited earlier.</p>

            <br>
            <p>While users greatly appreciated the ‘favorite folder’ option. We soon found that un-favoriting a folder
                became a hassle as users would need to navigate the folder tree again and un-favorite via the dropdown
                menu.</p>
            <br>
            <div class="halfPage">
                <div class="content1">
                    <p>The feedback from users prompted me to add an option to un-favorite a folder directly from the
                        dashboard widget. To accomplish this, I simply added an ‘X’ to each line item within the widget.
                        This way, users would not need to re-navigate the folder tree.</p>

            <br>
            <p>While the desired feature and the flow were quite straight forward in concept, unexpected hurdles such as
                choosing between which icons taught me that no matter how simple a task may seem it is still easy to
                overlook aspects. This was especially apparent when we realized we needed to add a way to un-favorite
                from the dashboard. It seemed ironic we spend so much time preparing a way to eliminate complex folder
                tree navigation but inadvertently created another case in which users would need to navigate the
                structure.</p>
